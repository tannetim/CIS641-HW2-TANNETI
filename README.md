## Term Project
This semester, I'm working on a project Inventory Management System is like a digital assistant for businesses. It keeps track of products, manages orders, and controls stock, ensuring the right amount of products at the right time. This prevents costly overstocking or understocking, streamlines order processing, and identifies top-performing products, ultimately saving money and improving business operations.
